# blog-ui

This repository contains HTML pages for the `blog-*` projects.

Each folder contains designed pages for one specific CSS framework (ex: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/), [Uikit](https://getuikit.com/), etc.).

**Disclaimer**: this is a personal project, not optimized and not production ready. Its only purpose is to discover and learn new frameworks.
